    "\n",
    "Binning is the common name for the set of approaches we can use for feature possible values range reducing. For example, we can split the continuous feature range into several parts and treat it like the categorical one. On the other side, we can merge some classes of the categorical variable. But why?\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the reasons depend on the type of feature we bin. For categorical ones, it's not good if we don't have enough observations in some classes. So our model won't be able to make confident predictions for this class (underfitting). Also binning is obviously effective mean against outliers in numerical features: every extremely huge or small characteristic value is hidden as another instance of the top or bottom bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's especially important that binning allows us to find and process non-monotonicity in numerical variables and hence we can make linear models work better without resorting to unstable and uninterpretable polynomial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point of linear model improvement and the common advantage of the binning technique for both categorical and numerical features is missing values processing. Also, you can get a deeper understanding of your data and make feature selection using some special metrics for binning results evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular application of binning is a bank scorecard building. So in the tutorial, we will talk about the task - binary classification (are customer good or bad?) and the model - logistic regression. But I'm sure that these concepts are applicable for linear regression tasks too.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how does it work?"

    "The bank scoring theoretician Lyn C. Thomas said that binning technique \"is as much art as it is science\". That's true and obviously, there are many algorithms of binning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trivial way is splitting into equal parts. We can do it cutting the range into intervals with equal width (same variable band into each bin) or with equal size (same number of observations).  But these methods don't count target distribution at all. Also, we don't have any criteria for the choice of optimal split-points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more advanced path is to apply powerful statistical tests. The main idea is quite simple too.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, we start with our previous step and for clarity let's split feature range into a number of the smallest intervals (one observation in each bin). As we mentioned in the introduction we are deciding a binary classification task, such as prediction of bank delinquencies. So we can write a target value 1 or 2 (for good and bad clients respectively) in every small bin on a training set. After adding the column of feature values we should arrange our table in feature ascending order. Imagine that we got something like this."

We can do it using Pearson's chi-squared distance."

    "If we have strong prior knowledge that the bad rate (or target rate, bad clients percentage) will be monotone in some variable then the best way is using Maximum likelihood monotone coarse classifier (MLMCC). It provides a strict linear dependence between predictor and bad rate i.e. the maximum likelihood splitting in full concordance with its name.\n",
